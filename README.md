# Video Basics

Challenge: to embed a video clip of your choosing. 
* The choice of the video is up to you, but you'll need to use the right attributes to mute the sound on the video. 
* It also should be set up to loop when it reaches its end.
* Finally, it should contain controls so the user can start and stop the video.
